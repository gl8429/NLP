Environment For El Captain
	Try `brew update` `brew doctor` first
	If it doesn't work, reinstall homebrew again by
		`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"`
		`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
	Then everything workswell.
