How to run?
        1.
	  You could create a new project in IntelliJ, then add ActiveLearner.java into the `src` file,
	  then you can create a new folder named `lib` and add `jars` in the lib folder into it and add
	  all `jars` into your library and you JDK should be 8. 
	  
	  Then you can run ActiveLearner.java in your IntelliJ project directly.
        2.
          Then you can check the output in trace directory, which will contain
		result // all formated result
		trees // trees generated while testing
	3.
	  Additionally, you can also run this project by command line, by the following format,
		`java -cp "stanford-parser.jar:slf4j-api.jar:" -server -mx1500m com.guangyu.ActiveLearner`
	  Notice, you need to move all jars to HW3-Guangyu Lin folder.


Output Trace?
        The output trace will be generated automatically.
        e.g. output_wsj_wsj_Brown.txt
	seed set name, self training set name, test set name
