Description of each file:

README:
	Description of all files

*.java:
	Source code of two different implementation

.*Result:
	Results of both models

report.pdf:
	Final report and disscussion of the experimental results

Execute Instruction:
1.Compile all java file first:javac *.java
2.Execute two models on different datasets.
    Example:
 	If you would like to execeute your dataset with BirdirectionalBigramModel, you could input the scripts like below.
        `java -cp "your current path"  nlp.lm.BidirectionalBigramModel "your dataset path" "your ratio of testing"`

 	If you would like to execeute your dataset with BackwardBigramModel, you could input the scripts like below.
        `java -cp "your current path"  nlp.lm.BackwardBigramModel "your dataset path" "your ratio of testing"`
